The purpose of this application is to quickly view SNAP enrollment at the County level. 

# Prerequisites:

1. R/RStudio Installation

2. Download the data used: https://github.com/michaelbbryan/tools-and-kaggles/tree/main/DataDive2022

3. Place a Census API Key in a file title "census_api_key" within the working directory. Sign up for a key here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html

# Next Steps:

Ideally, this application would be used to visualize SNAP participation vs. eligibility at the County level or greater. 
Currently, it displays SNAP participation as a percentage of 2020 population by county.
This does not achieve the goal of identifying enrollment "cold spots", but could be used as a starting point for an application that relies on a dataset containing that variable.
