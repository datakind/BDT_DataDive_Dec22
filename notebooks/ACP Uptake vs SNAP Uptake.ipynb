    "Background from BDT: Lifeline is an older FCC program that helps make communications services more affordable for low-income consumers (source: https://www.fcc.gov/lifeline-consumers). There is a new FCC program called Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) that helps ensure that households can afford the broadband they need for work, school, healthcare and more that replaced the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program. (source: https://www.fcc.gov/acp) Given ACP is newer and offers more benefits the priority is to look at ACP benefit enrollment versus SNAP benefit enrollment by geo (i.e. county). This will allow BDT to understand if there are specific regions where ACP enrollment is low relative to SNAP because being enrolled in SNAP is a qualifier for ACP. This comparison will need to use household data for SNAP because ACP is a household benefit.  "

    "Challenge: To understand current gaps it is ideal to look at the most recent data available and the lowest common geo granularity (county). ACP data is available at the county level and has very recent data available for this level- September 2022. SNAP data at the county level has a significant lag- most recent data is July 2021 (over a year older). This presents a gap in this analysis since a household enrolled in SNAP over a year ago may no longer be enrolled in SNAP or may have moved from that county. A comparison is made between the two but it is heavily caveated by the large time difference in the data points which may or may not provide useful directional trends. Also, it is recommended to redo this analysis with newer SNAP data once it is available. "

    "#### Open Questions: 1. Is it beneficial to compare old SNAP data with current ACP data? 2.The SNAP data divides persons and households into Public Assistance Participation and Non Public Assistance Participation. Currently the assumption is to use the combined Public Assistance Participation and Non Public Assistance Participation (\"Calc: SNAP Total PA and Non-PA Households\") to get the total households using SNAP. Is this valid? 3. There are some counties redacted in ACP data: \\**NOT AVAILABLE**. How should this be handled?\n"
