The goal of this project is to identify the community where SNAP benefits eligibility is high but enrollment is low.
In this folder, I created a Tableau heatmap to show the gap between total umemployemnt households and receiving SNAP umemployemnt households in 2021.
The data source used is https://data.census.gov/table?q=S2201&tid=ACSST5Y2020.S2201
The original data was cleaned by using python pandas and the counties with no data was droped.
## The final heat map in Tableau is https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/selina.su/viz/BDT_unploymentandSNAP/GapbetweenUnemploymnetandSNAPuptake?publish=yes

* SNAP Receiving % among Total unemployment families:17.48%
* GAP % Between Total and SNAP Receiving unemployment families: 82.52%

## High level correlation between total unemployment families and SNAP receving unemployment families
